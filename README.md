## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I Learned

1. **Responsive Design**: I implemented a responsive layout for the blog preview card using Flexbox. This allows the card to adapt to different screen sizes smoothly.

   ```css
   @media screen and (min-width: 200px) and (max-width: 1000px) {
       .main-container {
           width: 80%;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Smooth Scroll Behavior**: I set a smooth scroll behavior for the entire document, enhancing user experience when navigating the page.

   ```css
   html {
       scroll-behavior: smooth;
   }
   ```

3. **Hover Effects**: I utilized hover effects to create a more interactive experience. The main container changes its box shadow on hover, and the title changes color, indicating that they are clickable elements.

   ```css
   .main-container:hover {
       box-shadow: 15px 15px 0px 0px;
   }
   
   .body-content h1:hover {
       color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
       cursor: pointer;
   }
   ```

4. **Custom Fonts**: I integrated a Google Font (`Figtree`) to enhance the typography of the card, making it more visually appealing.

   ```css
   @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Figtree:wght@300..900&display=swap');
   ```

5. **CSS Variables and Custom Properties**: Although not directly shown in my code, learning about CSS variables can help manage colors and other properties more efficiently in future projects.

### Continued development

I am going to ponder on anything that might be helpful.

To also play arond css properties.
